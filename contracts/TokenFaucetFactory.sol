 * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see
 * {AccessControlEnumerable}.
 *
 * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed

 * using `public constant` hash digests:
 *
 * ```solidity
 * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256("MY_ROLE");

 *
 * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a

 *
 * ```solidity
 * function foo() public {
 *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));
 *     ...

 * ```
 *
 * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and
 * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only
 * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.
 *
 * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means
 * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other
 * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using
 * {_setRoleAdmin}.
 *
 * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to
 * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure
 * accounts that have been granted it. We recommend using {AccessControlDefaultAdminRules}
